Description: |
With this app you can create, save and change a fully customized order list in an easy way. Once, the list is created, an order can be placed very quickly by selecting the desired items and setting a quantity. If it is completed, the list can be sent via an e-mail, right out of the app without any copy-paste action.\nAs soon as you have added at least one item to the order list, you can it also maintain by means of a common text editor. The backend order list file custOrderList.xml is stored in the folder:\n.local/share/harbour-orderlist/harbour-orderlist/
